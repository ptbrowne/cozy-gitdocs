# Welcome to your new home

Hello, I’m Claude, Cozy support team member. Let me introduce you to your new home in the cloud.


## Our charter

Before starting the visit, I’d like to tell you a few words about our values. Our priority is to help you take back the control on your data, by importing them into a safe place, a place that you’re the only one to have access.

### In your personal cloud, you’re at home

By default, you are the only one that can access your data. (…)


### Your data belongs to you

Your are the one and only owner of the data stored on your cloud.

### Openness brings confidence

Cozy is and will stay a service built on free software: you can use, copy, improve the source code.

### You decide how your data can be used

Your Cozy server allows to control the data that you share with third party.


## Create your home in the cloud

Your home has an address. Your home in the cloud also has an address. Let’s choose it!
